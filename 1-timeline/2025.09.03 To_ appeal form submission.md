Subject: Re: Your YouTube Channel Suspension \- Request for Clarification and Re-evaluation \- \[@KarelTest\] 

Dear YouTube Team, 

The core of my problem is that I have already completed this one-time procedure inadequately and without a clear understanding of the alleged violation. 

The fundamental issue I am facing is a lack of specific information. I was informed of the suspension of my channel without prior warning and the only justification provided for my channel's termination was a generic reference to the "spam, scams, or commercially deceptive content" policy. This explanation is so broad that it is effectively meaningless, as no details were given as to which aspect of a specific videos was deemed to be in violation. Without this crucial information, it is impossible for a creator to understand, let alone rectify, the alleged mistake. 

I must honestly state that I navigated the one-time appeal process inadequately. The decision to suspend my channel came as a complete shock. The severity of the accusation—‘spam, deceptive practices and scams’—was deeply unsettling, and I was not prepared to formulate a proper response. Instead of using the appeal to seek clarification and present a well-reasoned case, my submission primarily reflected my bewilderment. For your reference, here is the sequence of events: Friday, August 15, 1:23 PM: I unexpectedly received the suspension notification. In a state of confusion, I hastily submitted the appeal form without proper preparation or a clear understanding of the specific violation. Saturday, August 16, 3:21 AM: I received a swift rejection of my appeal. After the rejection, I contacted @TeamYouTube on X.com to seek the clarification I should have requested earlier. They informed me that since an appeal had already been denied, they could no longer assist. This led me to send a formal letter to Google Ireland Limited on August 20, 2025 ; after which I received an email from YouTube Legal Support Team \<[legal+0rh36hxuz30z02o@support.youtube.com](mailto:legal+0rh36hxuz30z02o@support.youtube.com)\> redirecting me to this form ([https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/suspended?p=youtube\&sjid=14742410085278711687-EU](https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/suspended?p=youtube&sjid=14742410085278711687-EU)) .

As your emails did not provide me with any other clues, please allow me to make a new request for your assistance, which is twofold:

1. **Can you please provide specific information regarding the suspension?** To this day, I have no idea which video (or part of a video) violated a specific policy rule. It has been suggested that the name of my Chrome extension, "Google AI Studio \- File Reader," may have been perceived as a brand violation. This was never my intent. The videos were created solely as demonstration material for listings on the Chrome Web Store and the Google Workspace Marketplace. I am more than willing to change the name of the extension and the videos to ensure full compliance.  
   In order not to make the same mistake twice, I would really have to know what precisely I did wrong.

2. **Can I be granted an opportunity to appeal this decision in an adequate manner?** I acknowledge that my initial handling of the appeal was flawed. This was a direct result of being caught off-guard and not due to any malicious intent. I sincerely believe I have never knowingly violated YouTube's policies. The content on my channel consisted of only three demonstration videos: One for a Chrome extension that has been fully approved by the Chrome Web Store review team and is currently published with a growing user base. Two for Google Workspace add-ons, for which the creation of a video was a mandatory part of the Google OAuth 2.0 verification process. 

My sole intention has always been to contribute constructively to the Google and YouTube ecosystem. I was entirely unaware that my content was in violation of any policies. I sincerely apologize for any unintentional mistake. I respectfully ask for a second chance to rectify this situation and to bring my channel into full compliance with the guidelines of the YouTube platform.  
Thank you for your time and consideration of this important matter. 

Sincerely, 

Karel Decherf
