Subject: Re: Your YouTube Channel Suspension \- Follow-up with Detailed Analysis and Rectification Plan \- Channel: @KarelTest

To: legal+0rh36hxuz30z02o@support.youtube.com

Dear The YouTube Legal Support Team,

Thank you for your email of September 3, 2025\. I am writing to you directly today not merely to repeat my appeal, but to provide a thorough, well-researched analysis of the potential policy violations that led to my channel's termination. I was acting in good faith and hope to respectfully request a viable path to bring my channel into full and complete compliance with YouTube's guidelines.

The fundamental issue I have faced is a lack of specific information. The termination notice cited "spam, deceptive practices and scams," a category so broad that it was impossible to understand the specific error without further details. My initial, hastily submitted appeal reflected my bewilderment rather than a well-reasoned case, for which I sincerely apologize.

After extensive analysis, I have come to a clear understanding of the most probable cause. I believe my channel was terminated by an automated system flagging an unintentional but clear violation of Google's and YouTube's brand and impersonation policies. This violation was specifically triggered by the public-facing name of the application demonstrated in my final, and only public, video.

A critical detail in the timeline of events strongly supports this conclusion: The first two videos on my channel were set to 'Unlisted' or 'Private', as they were intended solely for the Google Workspace Marketplace verification process. These videos existed on the channel without any issue. However, the channel was terminated immediately and automatically on August 15, within hours of my uploading the third video as 'Public'. This sequence of events strongly suggests that the public visibility of this specific video's content triggered the enforcement action.

Below is my detailed analysis of the three videos that constituted my channel's entire library.

1\. Video: aistudiader 1.webm (Demonstrating "Google AI Studio \- File Reader") \- Published as 'Public'

Primary Issue (The Trigger): I now fully understand that the name of my Chrome extension, "Google AI Studio \- File Reader," when featured in a public video, is the most likely cause for the termination. It directly incorporates an official Google product name, which I now recognize creates an unintentional impression of official affiliation and violates YouTube's "deceptive practices" policy.

Context on Functionality and Positive Community Impact: While I now see the critical error in the name, I must provide context on the functionality. This extension is not malicious or deceptive in its purpose. On the contrary, it has been enthusiastically received by the community. Since its publication on the Google Chrome Web Store, it has rapidly gained a significant and growing user base. This strong positive reception demonstrates that the tool fulfills a genuine need for users of Google AI Studio. My work was entirely in the spirit of a third-party developer constructively building upon the Google ecosystem, based on direct community demand.

Good-Faith Assumption of Compliance: My belief that this naming was acceptable was reinforced by the fact that the extension was fully reviewed, approved, and published by the Google Chrome Web Store team. This approval from another part of the Google ecosystem mistakenly led me to believe the naming was compliant. I now understand that YouTube's enforcement policies are separate and more stringent.

2\. & 3\. Videos: YouTube Playlist Collector and OCR combi (Workspace Add-ons) \- Published as 'Unlisted'

Analysis: The names and content of these other videos may also contain elements that could be flagged (e.g., "YouTube Playlist Collector" or showing the "unverified app" screen). However, because these videos were 'Unlisted' and intended only for Google's own internal OAuth verification team for the Workspace Marketplace, they likely evaded the public-facing automated scans.

Compliance Context: These videos were a mandatory part of a verification process to demonstrate that the add-ons use the official YouTube Data API v3 and Google Sheets API correctly and do not violate any Terms of Service (e.g., through scraping). They are a testament to my attempts to follow official developer procedures.

I want to be unequivocally clear: it was never my intention to violate any policies, impersonate Google, or mislead any users. My sole intention has always been to contribute positively and constructively to the Google, YouTube, and wider internet ecosystem.

I sincerely apologize for this unintentional mistake. I believe my track record as a developer, with a published and approved extension on the Chrome Web Store that is valued by its users, demonstrates my commitment to being a constructive member of the community. I hope you will see this situation not as a malicious act, but as a learning experience for a developer who is eager to understand and comply with all platform rules.

Now that I have this understanding, I am 100% willing and prepared to take the following immediate corrective actions if given the opportunity:

Rename the Applications: I will immediately change the name of the "Google AI Studio \- File Reader" to a compliant name, such as "File Reader for AI Studio," and similarly adjust the "YouTube Playlist Collector" to "Playlist Collector for YouTube."

Delete and Re-record All Videos: I will permanently delete all three videos from the channel. I will then re-record the demonstrations showing only the correctly named, policy-compliant applications.

Ensure Correct Visibility and Add Disclaimers: Future verification videos will remain 'Unlisted'. Any public videos will include explicit disclaimers stating that the tools are from a third party and are not affiliated with, sponsored, or endorsed by Google or YouTube.

I am not asking you to overlook a policy violation. I am providing this detailed context to show that it was an unintentional, good-faith error made by a developer who is eager to contribute correctly. The permanent termination of my channel currently prevents me from making these necessary corrections.

I respectfully request the following:

Confirmation: Could you please confirm if my analysis is correct and that the channel was terminated due to the public video demonstrating an app with a name that violated brand policies?

A Chance to Rectify: I humbly ask for a temporary reinstatement of my channel, perhaps under a probationary status. This would grant me the necessary access to log in, delete all non-compliant content, and bring my channel into full and complete alignment with YouTube's guidelines.

Thank you for your time and for reconsidering this matter with the detailed context I have now provided. I am confident that, given the chance, I can be a responsible and valuable member of the YouTube creator community.

Respectfully,

Karel Decherf
