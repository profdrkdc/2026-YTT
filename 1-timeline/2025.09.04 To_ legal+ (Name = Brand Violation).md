Subject: Request for Re-evaluation of Channel Termination \- @KarelTest (https://youtube.com/channel/UCETh\_r8bn3OY09WLPnnANQA)

Dear YouTube Legal Support Team,

I am writing in follow-up to our previous correspondence, including your email of September 3, 2025, which redirected me to the standard appeal form. I understand the necessity of standardized procedures, but I must state that my initial appeals were inadequate because I lacked a clear understanding of the specific violation. The generic accusation of "spam, deceptive practices and scams" was too broad for me to formulate a proper and targeted defense.

After a thorough and detailed analysis of the videos on my channel, I have concluded that the termination was likely the result of an unintentional, algorithmic misinterpretation of my content. I believe this was a false positive—an error in the automated system.

My channel contained only three demonstration videos for legitimate, self-developed software. Based on a forensic review, I have identified the probable policy violations as follows:

aistudioreader 1.webm \- Unintentional Brand Violation (Most Likely Cause)  
This video demonstrated a Chrome extension named "Google AI Studio \- File Reader." It has become clear to me that the use of an official Google brand name in the product's title was the most critical error. This likely led YouTube's automated system to classify it with "high confidence" as a severe violation of policies against misleading practices, as it creates the impression of an official affiliation with Google.

YouTube Playlist Collector 1.0 \- Brand Impersonation & Dangerous Actions  
The name "YouTube Playlist Collector" may also have been flagged as a brand violation. The video also showed an unverified app requesting access to sensitive user data, which could have been perceived as a significant red flag by the enforcement systems.

OCR combi.webm \- Deceptive Practices  
This video showed an unverified Google Workspace add-on requesting extensive permissions. While this was a legitimate step in the verification process, it may have been mistaken by an overly zealous algorithm for a phishing attempt or scam.

I must emphasize that there was no malicious intent. The videos were purely for demonstration and validation purposes and were created to meet technical requirements for listings on the Chrome Web Store and Google Workspace Marketplace. I was unaware that the names I chose were in violation of your brand guidelines.

I am more than willing to change the names of the extensions and videos to be fully compliant with your policies and have already taken steps to do so. I sincerely apologize for this unintentional mistake and for any confusion it may have caused.

I respectfully request that a human reviewer re-evaluate my channel, bypassing the automated process that has, in this case, led to an unfair and disproportionate outcome.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Karel Test
