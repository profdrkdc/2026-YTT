I now think my channel was likely terminated for: "Trying to get viewers to install harmful software, or directing them to sites that might compromise their privacy." I understand that my videos created the perception of brand impersonation and bypassing security warnings.  
However, this is a critical misunderstanding. The videos were part of the store listing process for legit Google Workspace add-ons and Chrome extensions. It didn't involve harmful software. My goal was compliance with Google's own process.
