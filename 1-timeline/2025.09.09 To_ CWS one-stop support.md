CWS support form 2025-09-09 16.36.49

Hello Chrome Web Store Team,

I am a CWS developer facing a critical issue.

My YouTube channel (@KarelTest) was terminated after I uploaded a video meant for the CWS extension Google AI Studio \- File Reader (ID: holadmfpcclmpmkdkmcanifihneflfop) by what I've identified as an automated system error. This is critically important because this channel is required to host the unlisted videos for the mandatory OAuth 2.0 verification process for other work of mine (Workplace Add-ons).

I never received any warnings or strikes before the termination, and because of this termination, I am now banned for life from YouTube, unable to submit new extensions/add-ons or update existing ones that require OAuth verification. My standard appeals to YouTube were denied by automated systems that lack the context of my role as a CWS developer. My extension was seen as an intent to 'override Google's security' and 'trying to install malicious software'. But this is absolutely not the case, a human could have seen that.

This is a cross-platform issue that is preventing me from contributing to the Chrome Web Store ecosystem. Could you please escalate this internally to a team that can review the situation from a developer-relations perspective? I am ready to take all necessary corrective actions if my channel access is restored.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Karel Decherf
