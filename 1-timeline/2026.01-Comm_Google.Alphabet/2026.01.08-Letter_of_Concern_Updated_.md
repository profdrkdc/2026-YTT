**DATE:** January 8, 2026
**SUBJECT:** URGENT: Non-compliance with ACE Decision #2025-012481-YT, Whistleblower Penalty, and inaccessible legal contact points (DSA Violation).

---

**Dear Members of the Board and Executive Leadership of Alphabet and Google,**

I am writing to you today not as a litigant, but as a long-standing user and developer within the Google ecosystem, to express my deep concern regarding what appears to be a systemic breakdown in communication and regulatory compliance within your subsidiary, YouTube.

**Note on Communication Failure:**
*I previously attempted to send this letter to `legal-support@google.com` on January 6, 2026, but the message bounced because the address—often cited in past documentation—no longer exists. This inability to find a functioning, direct legal contact point for users is itself a concern regarding Digital Services Act (DSA) compliance.*

I am bringing this to your attention because I suspect that the leadership at Alphabet may not be fully aware of the severity of the situation at YouTube, where automated systems are failing to the point of penalizing users for reporting criminal activity, and where European law is being openly disregarded.

### 1. The Incident: Penalized for Reporting Fraud

My concerns stem from a recent incident where my YouTube account (**@KarelTest**) was terminated immediately after I reported a series of deceptive advertisements on the platform. These ads utilized a **sophisticated deepfake of the Prime Minister of Belgium** to promote fraudulent financial schemes.

Instead of addressing the fraudulent actors, YouTube’s automated systems terminated *my* account (the reporter) for "spam and deceptive practices." This "Whistleblower Penalty" suggests a critical flaw in YouTube’s moderation logic.

### 2. The Hacking Hypothesis and Lack of Investigation

I want to be very clear: I strongly suspect that my account may have been compromised (hacked) shortly after my report was filed. I have repeatedly requested a forensic audit of my account’s login activity to verify this. However, YouTube has consistently refused to investigate the possibility of a breach, choosing instead to issue a permanent ban without human review. This refusal to investigate a potential data breach is why I am cc'ing the Data Protection Officer.

### 3. Disregard for European Law (DSA) and ACE

To resolve this fairly, I escalated the matter to the **Appeals Centre Europe (ACE)**, a dispute settlement body certified under the **European Digital Services Act (DSA)**.

*   In cases **#2025-012481-YT** and **#2025-012487-YT**, ACE reached out to YouTube for information.
*   **YouTube completely failed to respond** to this certified authority.
*   This lack of cooperation resulted in a decision in my favor by default, yet YouTube continues to ignore the outcome.

The fact that YouTube feels entitled to ignore a certified European regulatory mechanism is not just a personal grievance; it is a significant compliance risk for Alphabet Inc. under the DSA.

### 4. Comparison with Google Search and Meta

What makes this situation particularly concerning is the lack of internal consistency within Alphabet. I have had similar technical or security-related issues with **Google Search** and **Meta (Facebook)**. In both instances, I was treated with professional transparency, provided with clear information regarding my rights, and my requests for rectification were handled correctly.

YouTube, however, operates in a "black box" that seems disconnected from the standards of professionalism and transparency that Alphabet usually upholds.

### 5. My Request

I am asking for your intervention to ensure that:

1.  A **human moderator** reviews this case, specifically looking at the timing of the report on the Prime Minister deepfake and the subsequent account termination.
2.  A **security audit** is performed to confirm whether my account was compromised by third parties.
3.  YouTube **acknowledges and acts upon the decision of the Appeals Centre Europe (ACE)**, as required by the DSA.
4.  My account **@KarelTest** is reinstated immediately.

I believe it is in Alphabet’s best interest to understand why its subsidiary is failing so fundamentally to respect European law and its own users. I hope this letter serves as a constructive signal to improve these systems.

I look forward to a meaningful response.

Sincerely,

**Karel Decherf**
