I now understand that the termination was not triggered by a single video, but by the combination of all three videos on my channel. Together, they unintentionally created a clear profile of a channel engaged in deceptive practices, specifically:

Systematic Brand Impersonation: Two of my videos demonstrated applications with names that directly incorporated official Google brands ("Google AI Studio - File Reader" and "YouTube Playlist Collector").

Systematic Promotion of Security Bypassing: Two videos provided a literal visual tutorial on how to ignore Google's own security warnings (clicking "Advanced" and "Go to... (unsafe)") and grant broad, high-risk permissions to an unverified application.

From the perspective of your systems, a channel that repeatedly impersonates your brands and teaches users to bypass your security measures is a threat. The "severe violation" and immediate termination without warning now make complete sense to me from that standpoint.

Crucial, Missing Context: Videos for Internal Google Verification

What your automated systems could not have known is the purpose of this content. The videos demonstrating the security bypass (OCR Combi and YouTube Playlist Collector) were created for one reason only: as a mandatory, non-public requirement for the Google Workspace Marketplace's OAuth 2.0 verification process.

I was, in effect, demonstrating to Google's own internal review team how my app handled the authentication flow. The problematic on-screen actions were not a tutorial for the public, but a required procedural step to prove compliance with Google's API usage policies.

Subject: Appeal for Reconsideration - Channel Termination

Dear YouTube Team,

I am writing to appeal the termination of my channel. I now understand the termination was due to a perceived pattern of "Systematic Brand Impersonation" and "Systematic Promotion of Security Bypassing" across three videos.

However, crucial context is missing. Two of the videos (OCR Combi and YouTube Playlist Collector), which demonstrated bypassing security warnings, were created solely for **internal Google Workspace Marketplace OAuth 2.0 verification**. They were mandatory, non-public submissions to show Google's review team how my app handled authentication, not public tutorials on bypassing security.

My intention was never to deceive or promote unsafe practices. I earnestly request you reconsider this decision based on this vital information.

Sincerely,

[Your Name/Channel Name]

Subject: Appeal for Reconsideration - Channel Termination (Harmful Software/Privacy)

Dear YouTube Team,

I am appealing my channel's termination, understanding it likely relates to "harmful software/privacy compromise." I now see how my three videos, in combination, presented a deceptive profile due to "Systematic Brand Impersonation" and "Systematic Promotion of Security Bypassing."

However, vital context is missing. The videos showing security bypasses (OCR Combi, YouTube Playlist Collector) were **mandated for internal Google Workspace Marketplace OAuth 2.0 verification**. They were not public tutorials, but demonstrations for Google's review team on app authentication.

My intent was never to distribute harmful software or compromise privacy. I respectfully request reconsideration given this crucial information.

Sincerely,

[Your Name/Channel Name]

*Thought process:*
```
**Reviewing Termination Appeal**

I'm now focusing on the appeal's core issue: the reason for the YouTube channel's termination. The suspected cause is directing viewers to potentially harmful sites. I must address this concisely, aiming for under 800 characters, to maximize chances of appeal approval.


**Refining the Appeal Strategy**

I've clarified the core violation, focusing on the alleged promotion of potentially harmful sites. Now, I'm integrating the crucial context: that the videos demonstrating security bypass were for Google's internal review, not public consumption. This justification is pivotal in framing the appeal and highlighting the misunderstanding by YouTube's systems.


**Analyzing Appeal Structure**

Now I'm focusing on crafting a persuasive structure. I'll start with a concise subject line addressing the specific policy violation. The opening will immediately acknowledge the perceived offense, followed by the crucial clarification regarding the videos' intended audience and purpose. I aim to reframe the situation and present the appeal within the strict character constraints.


**Drafting a Concise Appeal**

I've crafted a short draft for the appeal. It acknowledges the perceived violation, specifically the brand impersonation and security bypass, and emphasizes the videos' limited audience: Google's review team. Now, I'm integrating this context into a structure that starts with a clear subject line. My focus is still on brevity, aiming to stay under 800 characters while remaining persuasive. I am now refining the opening to create an immediate impact.


**Finalizing Appeal Draft**

I've crafted a final draft, maintaining a professional tone while staying under 750 characters. The core message focuses on the Google Workspace verification context, directly addressing the policy violation. The structure remains clear: acknowledging the perceived issue, providing the crucial context, and making a polite request for review. I'm satisfied with the clarity and conciseness of the draft, and it is now ready for submission.

Subject: Appeal for Reconsideration - Termination for Harmful Software Policy

Dear YouTube Team,

I am writing to appeal my channel's termination, which I believe was for: "Trying to get viewers to install harmful software, or directing them to sites that might compromise their privacy."

I now understand how my videos, showing brand impersonation and bypassing security warnings, created this perception. However, this is a critical misunderstanding. The videos demonstrating the security bypass were a mandatory, non-public requirement for **Google's own Workspace Marketplace OAuth verification process**.

They were intended solely for Google's internal review team, not as a public tutorial. My goal was compliance, not to compromise user security. I kindly request you reconsider my case with this vital context.

Sincerely,

[Your Name/Channel Name]

1. gebruik geen subject / titel . gebruik geen aanspreking . leg niet uit dat dit een appeal is
2. zeg meteen duidelijk het meest waarschijnlijk is dat """   Trying to get viewers to install harmful software, or directing them to sites that might compromise their privacy.   """  de reden was voor beëindiging van mijn kanaal , vernoem ook "brand impersonation and bypassing security warnings" ; dat dit "created this perception"
3. However, this is a critical misunderstanding. The videos were part of the store listing process for legit Google Workspace add-ons and Chrome extensions. It didn't involve harmful software"
4. "My goal was compliance"
