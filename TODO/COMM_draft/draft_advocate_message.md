**Subject: Seeking Guidance: Case Study of a Systemic "Catch-22" and DSA Violations by YouTube/Google**

Dear European Digital Rights, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and other defenders of digital rights,

I am a software developer writing to you today with a case that I believe is a clear example of the systemic failures in platform governance and a direct violation of the Digital Services Act (DSA) by Google/YouTube.

My business has been halted by a "catch-22" created by Google's own conflicting, siloed policies:
1.  **The Requirement:** Google requires a YouTube-hosted video for my application's OAuth verification.
2.  **The Automated Action:** YouTube's algorithm terminated my channel for an erroneous, unspecified reason.
3.  **The Trap:** I am now permanently banned from YouTube, making it impossible to comply with Google's other platform requirements. There is no human recourse.

This is not an isolated support ticket; it is an architectural flaw in Google's ecosystem that allows automated systems to create impossible, career-ending situations for developers. The company's failure to provide a specific, motivated reason for termination is also a clear breach of its obligations under Article 17 of the DSA.

I have documented the entire case, including all communications and a legal analysis, in an Open Letter available here: [Link to your public evidence page].

As leading advocates for digital rights, I believe my case could serve as a valuable, concrete example for your work in pushing for stronger platform accountability. I am seeking your guidance on:
-   The most effective way to structure and file a formal DSA complaint.
-   Whether this case aligns with any of your current advocacy or strategic litigation efforts.
-   Any advice you can offer for navigating this opaque and unjust process.

Thank you for your time and for your invaluable work in this space.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
