**Core Arguments for a Formal Complaint under the Digital Services Act (DSA)**

**Complainant:** [Your Name/Entity]
**Platform:** YouTube (a service of Google Ireland Limited)
**Subject:** Formal Complaint: Unjustified Channel Termination and Systemic Violations of the Digital Services Act by a Very Large Online Platform (VLOP)

---

### **1. Executive Summary of the Complaint**

Google/YouTube has terminated the channel "[Your Channel Name]" through a flawed, automated process and has failed to provide a means of redress, in direct violation of its obligations under the Digital Services Act. The termination has trapped the complainant in a "catch-22," where compliance with Google's own developer policies is made impossible by YouTube's enforcement actions. This represents a systemic failure of platform governance and a breach of multiple DSA articles.

### **2. Detailed Analysis of DSA Violations**

The actions taken by Google/YouTube constitute clear violations of the following articles of the DSA:

| DSA Article | Google's Obligation as a VLOP | Google's Action in this Case | Consequence for the User | Conclusion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Art. 17(1)** | Provide a "clear and specific statement of reasons" for any restriction. | Provided only a generic, boilerplate reason: "spam, deceptive practices, and scams." | The user cannot understand the specific allegation and is thus unable to mount a meaningful defense. | **Clear Violation.** |
| **Art. 17(3)(b)** | The statement must contain the specific "facts and circumstances" relied upon. | No facts or circumstances were provided. No reference was made to the specific video(s) or content at issue. | Without facts, challenging the decision is impossible. The user is forced to guess the reason. | **Clear Violation.** |
| **Art. 17(3)(c)** | The statement must disclose the "use of automated means" in the decision-making process. | No disclosure was made that the decision was taken and the appeal was rejected by automated means. | The user has no transparency into the nature of the decision-making process and no clear path to human review. | **Clear Violation.** |
| **Art. 17(3)(e)**| The statement must reference the specific "legal or contractual basis" for the decision. | No specific clause from the YouTube Terms of Service was cited. | The user cannot analyze the specific rule they allegedly broke, undermining their ability to appeal effectively. | **Clear Violation.** |
| **Art. 20** | Provide an "effective internal complaint-handling system" which is not "fully automated." | The appeal was handled by a fully automated system that confirmed the initial automated decision without apparent human review or consideration of the user's detailed explanation. | The right to an effective appeal is rendered meaningless. The process is illusory. | **Clear Violation.** |

### **3. The "Catch-22": A Systemic Failure of Platform Design**

The core of this complaint is the impossible situation created by Google's own internal silos.
-   Google's OAuth verification process **requires** a YouTube channel.
-   YouTube's automated moderation **terminated** that channel erroneously.
-   YouTube's circumvention policy **permanently bans** the user from the service, making compliance with the initial requirement impossible.

This is not merely a mistaken content moderation decision but an architectural flaw that creates disproportionate and destructive outcomes for developers who rely on the ecosystem.

### **4. Requested Remedy**

We request that the Digital Services Coordinator investigate this case and compel Google/YouTube to:
1.  Conduct an immediate, non-automated, human-led review of the original channel termination.
2.  Reinstate the channel "[Your Channel Name]".
3.  Provide a full, motivated, and DSA-compliant explanation for their actions to date.
4.  Review and reform the internal processes that allow for such destructive, cross-platform policy conflicts to occur.
