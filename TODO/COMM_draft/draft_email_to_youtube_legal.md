**Subject: Formal Complaint and Request for Urgent Human Review of YouTube Channel Termination - [Your Channel Name] - Violation of DSA Obligations**

**To:** legal@support.youtube.com
**Cc:** Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland

Dear YouTube Legal Support Team,

I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the unjustified termination of my YouTube channel, "[Your Channel Name]", on [Date of termination], and to request an urgent, human-led re-evaluation of this decision.

The termination has locked my business in an impossible "catch-22," a direct result of a systemic failure within Google's siloed policy enforcement. My developer work, which relies on Google's own ecosystem, requires me to use a YouTube channel for OAuth 2.0 verification videos. By terminating this channel, your automated system has simultaneously made it impossible for me to comply with Google's other policies and has blocked any path to resolution.

**Summary of DSA Violations and Factual Errors:**

The reason provided for termination was a generic reference to "spam, deceptive practices, and scams." This is factually incorrect and represents a clear violation of your obligations as a Very Large Online Platform (VLOP) under the Digital Services Act (DSA).

Specifically, your company is in breach of **Article 17 of the DSA** for the following reasons:
1.  **Lack of a Specific Statement of Reasons (Art. 17(1))**: The generic notice fails to provide any specific facts, circumstances, or references to the content that allegedly violated your policies.
2.  **Failure to Reference a Specific Legal or Contractual Basis (Art. 17(3)(e))**: The notice did not cite the specific clause of your Terms of Service that was breached.
3.  **Failure to Disclose Use of Automated Means (Art. 17(3)(c))**: The notice did not mention that the decision was made by automated means, which it clearly was.

The content in question was a standard, required video demonstrating the OAuth consent flow for my application. This is not a "scam"; it is a procedural requirement for developers working within your ecosystem. To penalize me for this is a categorical error that reveals a critical flaw in your automated moderation.

Furthermore, the rejection of my appeal via another automated message demonstrates a failure to provide an effective **Internal Complaint-Handling System (Article 20, DSA)** that involves meaningful human oversight.

**Requested Action:**

I demand a non-automated, human-led review of this case by a senior staff member with the authority to understand and override this cross-platform policy conflict.

A complete evidence package, including a timeline, all correspondence, and a technical analysis of the video, is available at: [Link to your public evidence page].

Please be advised that this is not a standard user complaint but a formal notice of a significant policy failure and multiple DSA violations. I expect a substantive, non-automated response within ten (10) business days.

Failure to provide a satisfactory resolution will compel me to escalate this matter by filing a formal complaint with the Digital Services Coordinator and pursuing all other available legal remedies.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Your Company/Developer Name]
