**Title: An Open Letter to the Developer Community: Caught in Google's Systemic "Catch-22"**

**To:** The Developer Community, Tech Journalists, and our Colleagues at Google

Since [Year], I have been a developer in the Google ecosystem, building tools that integrate with and, I hope, improve the services we all use. Today, my business is at a standstill, not because of a technical bug or a market shift, but because I am trapped in a paradoxical and broken process within Google itself.

I am writing this not just to seek a resolution for my own case, but as a warning to all developers who rely on Google's platforms: this can happen to you.

Here is the "catch-22" Google has created for me:
1.  To publish my software in the Chrome Web Store, Google **requires** me to provide a video of my app's OAuth consent screen. This video **must** be hosted on a YouTube channel.
2.  My YouTube channel, which existed for this purpose, was recently terminated by an automated system for an unspecified, generic reason ("spam/scam"). My appeal was denied by another automated system within minutes.
3.  Because of YouTube's "channel termination circumvention" policy, I am now permanently banned from ever owning, accessing, or creating another YouTube channel.

The very process Google demands of me is the one its own automated systems now prevent me from completing. My ability to work, to publish updates, and to support my users has been completely severed by a conflict between two disconnected parts of the same company.

This is not a user error. This is a **systemic failure**. It is the predictable outcome of a corporate structure that allows its product silos to operate without accountability to one another, all while relying on opaque, context-blind algorithms to make decisions with career-ending consequences.

All my attempts to find a human at Google who can understand this cross-product conflict have failed. The support system is a maze of automated rejections and dead ends.

This is not the kind of ecosystem that fosters innovation. It is an environment where developers are treated as disposable, and where our businesses can be destroyed overnight by a flawed algorithm without any meaningful recourse.

I am not asking for special treatment. I am asking for a process that is transparent, rational, and respects the developers who build on Google's platforms. I am asking for a human review by someone who can see beyond the walls of their product silo.

I have published a complete record of this case, including all communications and a technical analysis, here: [Link to your public evidence page].

I urge my fellow developers to recognize the precarity of our position. I urge journalists to investigate these opaque systems of platform governance. And I urge someone at Google to look at this case and recognize the architectural flaw in your own processes before more developers are harmed.
