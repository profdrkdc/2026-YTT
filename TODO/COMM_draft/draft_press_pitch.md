**Subject: Pitch: A Developer's "Catch-22" - How Google's Broken, Siloed Policies Are Destroying Businesses**

Dear [Journalist Name],

I am writing to you because you cover platform governance, the power of Big Tech, and the real-world impact of automated systems.

I have a story that serves as a perfect, personal microcosm of a massive systemic problem at Google. It's a "catch-22" created by the company's own internal rules that has paralyzed my software business.

In short:
1.  **Google's Rule:** To publish my app in the Chrome Web Store, I am required to host a verification video on YouTube.
2.  **Google's Action:** YouTube's algorithm terminated my channel for an unspecified, erroneous reason ("spam/scam").
3.  **The Trap:** I am now permanently banned by YouTube from creating a new channel, making it impossible for me to comply with the initial Google requirement.

This isn't just a support issue; it's an architectural flaw in how Google governs its ecosystem. I am trapped between the conflicting, automated enforcement of two powerful, disconnected silos. The case also involves clear violations of the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), as no specific, motivated reason for the termination was ever provided.

I have written an Open Letter to the developer community detailing this experience, which you can read here alongside all supporting evidence (emails, timeline, etc.):

This story is more than one developer's struggle. It’s about opaque algorithmic justice, the failure of DSA compliance, and the immense, unchecked power Google's internal bureaucracy has over the small businesses that build on its platforms.

I am available to speak at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

**How to Find and Contact Journalists:**

1.  **Identify the Right People:** Look for journalists at major publications (e.g., The Verge, TechCrunch, Bloomberg, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal) who consistently write about Google, antitrust issues, content moderation, or the DSA. Search their publication's website for their articles.
2.  **Use X (Twitter):** Most tech journalists are very active on X. Follow them and engage with their work respectfully. Their DMs are sometimes open, or you can @-mention them in a concise summary of your story (linking to your Open Letter).
3.  **Check Their Profiles:** Journalists often list their email address or a link to a secure contact form (like Signal) in their X bio.
4.  **Use General Press Inboxes:** If you cannot find a direct contact, send your pitch to the publication's general press or "tips" email address (e.g., `tips@theverge.com`). Frame the subject line to be as compelling as possible.
