I'm a developer trapped in a Google "catch-22".

1. Google requires a YouTube video for my app's verification.
2. @YouTube's AI terminates my channel for "spam".
3. I'm now permanently banned from YouTube & can't comply with Google's requirement.

My business is paralyzed.

This isn't just my problem; it's a systemic failure at Google that can affect any developer. The automated, siloed enforcement between @YouTube, @GoogleCloud, and @ChromeDevs creates impossible situations with no human recourse.

I've exhausted all standard support channels, so I've written an Open Letter detailing the entire ordeal, including the flawed automated process and the specific DSA violations.

I'm asking for a human review to fix this broken process. I'm calling on @TeamYouTube, @YouTubeCreators, and especially @addyosmani to look at this. Devs need a fair and transparent system. #PlatformAccountability #Catch22 #DevCommunity
