# Product Guidelines: 2026-YTT Dossier

## Prose and Linguistic Style
- **Technical & Precise:** Utilize exact terminology from the **Digital Services Act (DSA)**, Google's Terms of Service, and YouTube's Community Guidelines.
- **Narrative & Chronological:** Maintain a clear story-driven approach for the timeline to build a coherent narrative of system failure.
- **Evidence-First:** Every claim or argument MUST be preceded or immediately followed by a direct reference to a timestamp, screenshot, or file path.
- **Bilingual (Dutch/English):** Draft core arguments and the executive summary in both Dutch (for local regulatory context) and English (for international Google/YouTube review).

## Formatting and Presentation: Digital Dossier Website
- **Primary Interface:** The dossier will be presented as a structured, professional **website** to allow for easy navigation and interactive evidence review.
- **Modern UI:** Utilize a clean, accessible design (e.g., Vite/React with Material Design or similar) suitable for legal and corporate review.
- **Interactive Timeline:** Implement a searchable, filterable timeline that links directly to digital evidence (images, logs, code snippets).
- **Standard Format:** Use **Markdown** for all content sources, which will be rendered dynamically by the website.
- **Exportable PDF:** The website should allow for the generation or download of specific sections as **PDF** for formal submissions.
- **Cross-Referencing:** Use explicit internal links to create a verifiable chain of proof across the site.
- **Call-Outs:** Use bold text or specific UI elements to highlight legal violations (e.g., **VIOLATION: Failure to provide Statement of Reasons**).

## Handling Personal Context
- **Relevance-Based Integration:** Personal history regarding reintegration and recovery should be introduced only when relevant to refuting "malicious intent" or demonstrating the disproportionate "impact" of the termination.
- **Objective Framing:** Present personal history factually and without emotional pleading, focusing on its relevance to the case's context.
