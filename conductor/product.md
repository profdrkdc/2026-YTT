# Initial Concept\nThe project is a Documentation and Legal Strategy Dossier focused on the wrongful termination of the "@KarelTest" YouTube channel.

## Target Stakeholders
- **Regulatory Bodies & ODS Instances:** Providing evidence for formal complaints under the Digital Services Act (DSA) and other regulatory frameworks.
- **Google/YouTube Legal & Support:** Presenting a structured case to human reviewers to bypass automated rejection loops.

## Core Objectives
- **Account Reinstatement:** Restoring access to the @KarelTest YouTube channel and associated developer permissions (Google Workspace Marketplace/CWS).
- **Transparency & Explanation:** Compelling Google to provide a specific, non-generic explanation for the "spam, deceptive practices, and scams" allegation, as required by law.

## Critical Evidence & Arguments
- **Comprehensive Timeline:** A meticulous record of all events from the moment of termination to the latest correspondence.
- **Developer Requirements:** Proof that uploaded videos were functional requirements for Google Workspace Marketplace and Chrome Web Store (CWS) verification processes, not "spam."
- **Procedural Failures:** Documentation of the lack of prior warnings and the failure of Google to provide a "Statement of Reasons" as mandated by **DSA Article 17**.
- **Systemic Context:** Highlighting that the termination is part of a broader pattern of "guilt by association" and algorithmic errors.

## Presentation Strategy
- **Tone:** Professional, objective, and fact-based, yet legally grounded.
- **Narrative:** Framing the user as a legitimate developer and a victim of automated system failures rather than a malicious actor. This is supported by the user's personal context of reintegration and recovery.
