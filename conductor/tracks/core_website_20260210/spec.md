# Specification: Core Website & Interactive Timeline

## Goal
Create a professional, responsive web application to serve as the primary interface for the 2026-YTT Dossier. The key feature is an interactive timeline that visualizes the termination events and links to evidence.

## Requirements
- **Project Scaffolding:** Initialize a Vite project with React and TypeScript.
- **UI Framework:** Integrate Material UI (MUI) or a similar Material Design library.
- **Content Engine:** Implement a mechanism to fetch and render Markdown files from the 'conductor' and '1-timeline' directories.
- **Interactive Timeline:**
    - Chronological display of events.
    - Filtering by event type (e.g., Correspondence, Action, Legal).
    - Deep linking to evidence files (images, PDFs, code snippets).
- **Bilingual Support:** Basic infrastructure for Dutch/English content switching.
