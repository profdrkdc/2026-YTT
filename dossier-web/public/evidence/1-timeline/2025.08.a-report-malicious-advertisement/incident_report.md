# Incident Report: Malicious Advertisement Reporting (August 2025)

**Reporter:** Karel Test (@kareltest_)
**Incident Type:** Moderation Failure / Deepfake Crypto Scam
**Status:** YouTube found "No Violation"

## Incident Description
In August 2025, I identified and reported a very obvious deepfake advertisement running on YouTube. The ad featured the Belgian Prime Minister, Alexander De Croo, appearing to advocate for shady cryptocurrency investments. 

## Context of Previous Reports
Prior to this incident, I had reported several other "dodgy" or malicious ads. In those instances, YouTube provided appreciative responses and took action, establishing a history of me acting in good faith to improve platform safety.

## Outcome
Despite the clear violation of policies regarding:
1. **Misleading Metadata & Scams**
2. **Impersonation (Deepfake)**
3. **Harmful Financial Content**

YouTube responded to this specific report stating that they found **"no problem at all"** with the ad. 

## Significance
This evidence proves:
- **Good Faith Effort:** I proactively used platform tools to report actual harm.
- **Systemic Failure:** YouTube's automated or manual moderation failed to identify a high-risk deepfake scam involving a world leader, while simultaneously terminating my legitimate developer-focused channel for "spam."
