Subject: Critical Developer Block: Cross-Platform Issue (YouTube \<\> Workspace) Blocking Add-on Publication

Dear Justin,

I came across your incredibly helpful AMA on the r/googleworkspacedevs subreddit. I'm reaching out because I've encountered a critical cross-platform issue that is blocking my development work, and your role as a Developer Advocate seems perfectly suited to understand this complex situation.

In short: an erroneous, automated termination of my YouTube channel (@KarelTest) has completely blocked my ability to publish any Google Workspace Add-ons, due to the mandatory video requirement for the OAuth verification process.

Here is a summary of what happened:

1\. The Trigger Event The termination was triggered after I uploaded a required demonstration video for my Chrome Web Store extension, "AI Studio File Reader". I also had videos on there for Google Workspace Add-ons as a requirement for the OAuth 2.0 verification process (add-ons: OCR Combi , YouTube Playlist Collector).

2\. Forensic Analysis of the Automated Error Having thoroughly reviewed the YouTube policies and the video content, I am confident the termination was an automated error. The videos were benign. The last video showed a simple, harmless drag-and-drop file conversion and did not contain any OAuth flow or security bypass instructions.

I believe the automated system made a critical mistake based on two likely false positives:

Unintentional Brand Impersonation: The name "AI Studio File Reader" was likely flagged for using a Google product name ("AI Studio"). I now understand this can be a policy violation and am ready to correct it (although thousands and thousands of YouTube videos have similar product and brand names in their title).

Misinterpreted Functionality: It's plausible that the video's legitimate drag-drop-and-download function was misidentified by the AI as a suspicious pattern resembling a malware dropper.

3\. The Consequence: A Developer "Catch-22" This single, misinterpreted video resulted in a permanent, lifetime YouTube ban. This ban has now created an inescapable trap:

I am now permanently blocked from publishing any future Chrome Extensions or Google Workspace Add-ons.

The reason is my inability to upload the separate videos required for their individual OAuth 2.0 verification processes.

4\. Exhausted Channels I have hit a bureaucratic wall trying to resolve this through all standard channels:

YouTube Appeal: Denied by an automated system that lacks the crucial context of me being a developer fulfilling a CWS requirement.

Chrome Web Store Support: Responded that they are unable to assist with issues related to YouTube accounts.

Google Cloud Support: To file a technical case, I am now required to subscribe to a paid "Standard Support" plan ($29/month), which is an unreasonable barrier to report a systemic, cross-platform issue.

This is a clear cross-platform issue that started with a CWS requirement and is now preventing me from contributing to the Google ecosystem.

My question for you is not to solve this directly, but to ask for your guidance. Could you please help escalate this case internally to a team that can review a cross-platform problem from a developer-relations perspective?

I am fully prepared to rename the extension and take any other corrective actions required. My primary goal is simply to have this disproportionate, ecosystem-wide ban lifted so I can continue to develop on the Google platform.

Thank you for your time and for your advocacy work on behalf of the developer community.

Best regards,

Karel Decherf
