## Possible Faults on My Part

1. content not fit for public video on YouTube -- quality just not there
2. copyright infringement -- 'Google AI Studio' brand name
3. comment used 'violent language' -- "you're killing it Jules"
4. video looked like scam -- looked like trying to get users to download malware
5. video not set to private...


## Counter-arguments
### 1. content not fit for public video on YouTube -- quality just not there
This is possible, but to be immediately suspended without warning for this is extreme.

### 2. copyright infringement -- 'Google AI Studio' brand name
This is possible, but YouTube is full of videos that have such brand names in their title or on their thumbnail/miniature.

### 3. comment used 'violent language' -- "you're killing it Jules"
This is possible, but here too there are many examples of videos that use such language; also, Google never designated this comment or this language as the reason for the suspension -- which they should have done according to DSA Art. 17 if this was the reason.

### 4. video looked like scam -- looked like trying to get users to download malware
This is possible, but a human review would undoubtedly have detected that this was not the case.

### 5. video not set to private
This is possible, but then direct suspension without prior warning would be disproportionate.
