## Possible Faults on Google's Part

1. no warning.
2. no sufficiently specific reason provided.
3. no specific indication of exactly which element, which passage in which video caused the problem.
4. channel hacked? Shortly before the suspension, I had reported a malicious deepfake video, and the response was that there was no problem with the advertisement (although that was clearly the case); very shortly thereafter, my channel was suspended without warning, without sufficiently specific reasons, without indication of which specific part of my content violated which rule.
5. outright disregard of DSA.
6. inadequate AI that hinders or blocks proper review.
7. inadequate procedure.
8. outright disregard of OCDS (ACE) investigation/procedure and ruling.
