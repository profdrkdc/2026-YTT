# Spam, deceptive practices, & scams policies

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. Take the time to carefully read the policy below. You can also check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.  
YouTube doesn’t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community. We also don’t allow content where the main purpose is to trick others into leaving YouTube for another site.  
 

If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

## What these policies mean for you

### If you're posting content

Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.

* Video Spam: Content that is excessively posted, repetitive, or untargeted and does one or more of the following:  
  * Promises viewers they'll see something but instead directs them off site.  
  * Gets clicks, views, or traffic off YouTube by promising viewers that they’ll make money fast.  
  * Sends audiences to sites that spread harmful software, try to gather personal info, or other sites that have a negative impact.  
* Misleading Metadata or Thumbnails: Using the title, thumbnails, or description to trick users into believing the content is something it is not. This includes titles, thumbnails, or descriptions leading viewers to believe they will see something in a video, but then not including it in the video content itself.  
* Scams: Content offering cash gifts, “get rich quick” schemes, or pyramid schemes (sending money without a tangible product in a pyramid structure).  
* Incentivization Spam: Content that sells engagement metrics such as views, likes, comments, or any other metric on YouTube. This type of spam can also include content where the only purpose is to boost subscribers, views, or other metrics. For example, offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel solely in exchange for them subscribing to your channel, also known as "Sub4Sub" content.  
* Comments Spam: Comments where the sole purpose is to gather personal info from viewers, misleadingly drive viewers off YouTube, or perform any of the prohibited behaviors noted above.  
* Repetitive comments: Leaving large amounts of identical, untargeted or repetitive comments. Note that this type of engagement may lead to the removal of your comments.  
* 3rd party content: Live streams that include unauthorized 3rd party content that are not corrected after repeated warnings of possible abuse. Channel owners should actively monitor their live streams and correct any potential issues in a timely manner.

This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.

Note: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment.

## What happens if content violates this policy

If your content violates this policy, we may suspend your monetization or terminate your channel or account. Learn more about [monetization policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392) and [channel or account terminations](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168).

For some violations, we may remove the content and issue a warning or a strike against your channel. If this happens, we’ll send you an email to let you know.

You can take an optional policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if your content violates the same policy within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. Learn more about [our strike system](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032).

# Impersonation policy

Content intended to impersonate a person or channel is not allowed on YouTube. YouTube also enforces trademark holder rights. When a channel, or content in the channel, causes confusion about the source of goods and services advertised, it may not be allowed.

De meest waarschijnlijke reden voor de verwijdering van je kanaal blijft gerelateerd aan het beleid tegen **identiteitsfraude en misleiding**, maar met een andere focus.

Het probleem is waarschijnlijk de naam van je extensie en het onderwerp van de video:

* De naam van je extensie is **AI Studio File Reader**.  
* De extensie is ontworpen om te werken met **Google AI Studio**.

Dit kan door YouTube's geautomatiseerde systemen zijn opgepikt als een poging om zich voor te doen als een **officieel Google-product of een officiële Google-tool**. YouTube heeft een zeer streng beleid om de merken van Google te beschermen en te voorkomen dat derden hun naam gebruiken om gebruikers te misleiden.

Zelfs als je intentie was om een nuttige en legitieme tool te maken, kan het gebruik van de term "AI Studio" in combinatie met het promoten van een niet-officieel product op YouTube, hebben geleid tot een onmiddellijke beëindiging van je kanaal zonder voorafgaande waarschuwing. De systemen van Google zijn zeer gevoelig voor dergelijke potentiële inbreuken op hun merkrichtlijnen.

---

### **Wat je nu kunt doen**

Je beste optie is nog steeds om **bezwaar te maken** bij YouTube. Het feit dat je video geen expliciete inhoudelijke problemen heeft, maakt je case sterker.

* Leg in je bezwaar uit dat je de video hebt gemaakt om een legitieme Chrome-extensie te demonstreren.  
* Vermeld dat de extensie is goedgekeurd in de Chrome Web Store.  
* Geef aan dat het niet je intentie was om de regels te overtreden of om je voor te doen als een officiële entiteit van Google.

Dit geeft het team van YouTube de context die het geautomatiseerde systeem heeft gemist en kan leiden tot een heroverweging van de beslissing.

My channel, [**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCETh\_r8bn3OY09WLPnnANQA**](https://c.gle/ANiao5rdHOJXJH_WnijRNm2Lqzv8JYsLIGQI2CNKHXOFAR6PjHWRMxkfCCdRn6JXCGk9KQ3tUyWPhSKgcZnz-ulD-C_jh8c88hNkCqumOZgiGBoqLdtb2tN3_E5HEEH8uh7SG-BrRBRya6DkZ355oMkhq2XG_jWjYg), was terminated. The single video on it was a demonstration of my Chrome extension, **Google AI Studio \- File Reader, Status: Published \- public, ID: holadmfpcclmpmkdkmcanifihneflfop**. The extension was approved by the **Chrome Web Store**. I suspect the use of the term "Google AI Studio" may have been perceived as a brand violation. This was not my intent. The video was simply intended to demonstrate the extension's functionality in the store listing.

I am willing to change the name of the extension and the video to ensure full compliance with your guidelines. 

I kindly request a new review of my channel and video. There was no malicious intent to violate any policies. Thank you for your consideration.
