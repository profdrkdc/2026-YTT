## Summary of the Dossier

This dossier details the wrongful termination of the "@KarelTest" YouTube channel, an account primarily used for legitimate development purposes.

**Channel Activities:**
*   The channel was created and videos were uploaded specifically for **Google Workspace Marketplace OAuth verification** and **Chrome Web Store (CWS) store listing promotional videos**.
*   The channel also actively contributed to maintaining YouTube's safety by **reporting unwanted scam advertisements**, demonstrating a commitment to platform integrity.

**Unjust Suspension:**
*   Despite these efforts, the channel was **suspended without warning** and without any specific, actionable reasons provided by YouTube.
*   This suspension was part of an **automated process**, which tragically led to a lack of human oversight.

**Lack of Support and Due Process:**
*   Attempts to seek assistance from YouTube's official support channels, including **@TeamYoutube** (as documented in [evidence/1-timeline/2025.09.08 @kareltest_ X @TeamYoutube.json](evidence/1-timeline/2025.09.08%20@kareltest_%20%20X%20@TeamYoutube.json)), were met with refusal to help.
*   **No department within YouTube offered an explanation** for the alleged transgression, nor was there any opportunity provided to rectify or appeal the situation effectively.
*   Even **legal support avenues proved unhelpful**.
*   This complete lack of transparency and opportunity for redress stands in **direct violation of Article 17 of the Digital Services Act (DSA)**, which mandates clear and specific reasons for content moderation decisions and effective redress mechanisms.
*   Furthermore, **out-of-court dispute settlement (ACE) was entirely ignored**, exacerbating the lack of recourse.

The termination highlights systemic issues within automated content moderation, where legitimate development work and positive platform contributions can be unjustly penalized without due process.
